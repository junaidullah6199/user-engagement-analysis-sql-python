# User Engagement Analysis Using Python & SQL

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Yelp restaurant data to examine how user engagement metrics (reviews, tips, check-ins) influence business success indicators such as review count and average star rating.

The objective is to understand engagement behavior and provide data-driven recommendations for improving restaurant performance.
